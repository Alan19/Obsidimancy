description = '''
Obsidimancy is a mod that allows the player to discover artifacts from a precursor civilization that harnessed obsidian to empower their tools with dimensional energies. Each artifact will take the form on an armor piece, tool, or Curio that can be attuned and upgraded with the power of each of the 3 vanilla dimensions, giving each artifact a lot of options.
